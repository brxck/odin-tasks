# [OdinTasks](http://brockmcelroy.com/odin-tasks/)

> This is a project for [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list)

OdinTasks is a todo list inspired by Trello. Check it out [here.](http://brockmcelroy.com/odin-tasks/)

It is implemented primarily in plain JavaScript.

I was tempted to use Pug mixins to generate the page content, but I opted to write much more JavaScript as practice.
